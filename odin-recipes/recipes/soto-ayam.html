		<h1>Instructions</h1>

		<h2>Prep the Chicken</h2>
		<ol>
			<li> Skin the chicken</li>
			<li>Combine the stock, kaffir lime leaf, lemongrass and salt
				in a pot large enough to hold all the ingredients. Bring to a simmer</li>
			<li>Add the chicken and simmer until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of
				170F. This should take 15-20 minutes, don't boild. Simmer with little bubbles</li>
			<li>Remove the chicken from the broth. Blot dry. Set aside. You can also turn off the heat
				under the broth for now</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>Fry the chicken</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>If you fried shallots just keep going with the chicken. If not heat around 2 cups of il in a frying
				pan large enough to hold half the chicken (4 thighs). A spatter guard isn't a bad idea here if you have one
			</li>
			<li>Fry on one side for about 2-3 minutes. Flip the chicken and cook another 2-3 minutes. You want the chicken to
				brown but you don't want to cook it to death.. Remove the chicken and repeat with the other 4 thighs. Set aside
				to
				cool enough to handle</li>
			<li>When it's cool enough pull the chicken off the bone and shred it</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>Medium boil the eggs</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Bring enough water to cover the eggs by one inchg to a boil in a small saucepan. Add the eggs and set a timer.
				You want to cook them exactly seven minutes</li>
			<li>After seven minutes remove them from the pan and submerge in an ice bath. This stops the egg from cooking
				more. This should get you about a perfect medium boiled egg. peel but don't slice them yet.</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>Assemble the soto ayam</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Bring the broth to a lively simmer. Taste it. Be careful. It's hot. It will need more salt.
				It will be somewhere around another 1/2 to full teaspoon. maybe more, season to your taste</li>
			<li>To soften the rice vermicelli just fully submerge it in the hottest water you can get out of your tap
				Let it sit five minutes and drain. Rinse with cold water. People that tell you to cook rice mermicelli like to
				eat rice noodle mush</li>
			<li>Have your garnishes ready. Slice your eggs in half, use a sharp knife and be careful. Those yolks are still
				soft.</li>
			<li>To serve place 1/4 of the rice noodles in each of 4 bowls. Divide the chicken and place it on the
				vermicelli. Top with fried shallots and cilantro. Pour 2 cups of broth into each bowl. Add one egg and a
				slice of lime per bowl. Serve. Add sambal oelek to taste. Enjoy</li>
